          Ik ben Damian Jordan, ik ben 22 jaar oud en ik hou van video games.
          Verder heb ik ook een interesse voor programmering en woon ik in
          Almere-Buiten.

        <h3>Mijn hobbies</h3>
        <p>
          Mijn hobbies zijn video games, voornamelijk RPGs zoals Final Fantasy
          14, en, waar ik het nog verder op deze site zal hebben, Warhammer
          40.000.

          It is the 41st millenium. Humanity is constantly on the brink of
          extinction due to various threats: the vile, daemonic powers of Chaos,
          the alien and strange forces of Xenos and humanity itself. For in the
          grim darkness of the far future, there is only war.

          Welcome to Warhammer 40.000, also known as Warhammer 40K! This is a
          very vast and expansive universe that I and many other partake in. In
          Warhammer 40K, there is only death and destruction. Every faction,
          such as the Imperium of Man, the Aeldari, the Orks, the Necrons, the
          forces of Chaos, the Tyranids, is some flavor of evil. Something about
          them makes them evil. The Imperium of Man is a highly fanatical,
          xenophobic and extermely religious group of people that worship their
          god, the God-Emperor of Mankind. The Aeldari are essentially space
          elves, complete with magical powers. Chaos is the main "evil" and
          reside in the Warp, being certain aspects of people amplified to the
          max, such as Khorne being about honorable combat but also blood and
          murder. Orks, they just want a good old time fighting with people and
          are just as likely to kill each other as they are to kill a human or
          an Eldar (one of those space elves). Tyranids are giant bugs looking
          for their next meal. The T'au fight for the "greater good", while also
          essentially brainwashing whoever joins them. If any (or all!) of that
          sounds interesting, feel free to take a look around! If not, thank you
          for even reading this far!

        <h2>THE BEGINNING</h2>
        <h5>The actual start of Warhammer</h5>
        <img

        <p>
          If you made it this far, I assume you are somewhat interested. Good!
          Again, I welcome you! This will be explaining the actual start of all
          of Warhammer. For more detailed answer on certain things, such as but
          certainly not limited to: "Who is the God-Emperor of Mankind?", "Who
          are the Aeldari?", "What are Orks and why do they love fighting so
          much?", "Why is Chaos 'evil'?", "What is the T'au's 'greater good'?"
          "Why is there magic in a sci-fi setting?", "What the heck is the Warp?
          The heck is a Khorne?" And many, many more questions you are sure to
          have, there will be a navigation bar at the top linking to most of the
          'super factions', those being the Imperium of Man for everything
          relating to the Imperium that is still loyal to the God-Emperor
          (including said God-Emperor), Chaos for everything surrounding Chaos
          and the 4 Chaos Gods and Xenos for all of the alien races of 40K
          including but not limited to: Eldar, Necrons and Orks. This will be a
          very intensive look at everything, so this site will not be entirely
          read immediately. But let's begin at the beginning shall we?
